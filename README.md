## Overview
### Description
Fitness app that where a user can log calories and track them for a specific calorie goal to hit. The app also has individualized meal prep plans and personalized workouts based on if the user wants to lose, maintain, or gain weight.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Fitness / Health
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer to track calories throughout the day or even when cooking meals to view recipes. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyze users choice of eating habits and goals, and provide steps and options to reach intended goals. And once user has hit such weight goals, they can create new goals which we can assess and then provide specified steps and options to achieve the new goal.
- **Market:** Any individual could to use this app, and it is intended for people that want to be more active or need help when changing to a more active lifestyle. 
- **Habit:** This app would be used frequently as they would have it open when working out, cooking a specific recipe, or when logging in calories. It would be an app users open daily as people eat every day and would track the calories of meals.
- **Scope:** First we would start by asking people if they want to lose, maintain, or gain weight. Then we would show them specific meal preps, workouts, and a personalized calorie goal to reach everyday based on their choice. Large potential for use with athletes and people who want a change in their life and lead a healthier lifestyle.

## Unit 13 Checklist

### Updated status of issues in Project board (2pts)
Project Board has been updated. The important parts are completed and all remaining tasks were jobs we never got around to accomplishing.

### Sprint planned for next week (Issues created, assigned & added to project board) (3pts)
There are no more sprints as we present the app tomorrow. Overall, we did a pretty good job at following our ideas for our upcoming sprints. The only thing that was unexpected throughout sprint planning was how many times we had to change our goals for our sprint early in development. Sometimes it was because our ideas were easier than expected, but most of the time it was because we overplanned for a week and had to reevaluate what we cvould realistically get done.

### Completed user stories checked-off in README (2pts)
User stories are all completed. We ended up adding other features to our app that we felt were needed while also removing certain features that we decided were no as important as originally thought. There were features that we never got around to completing, but if we were to flesh out the idea of our app into something we actually put out into the app store, we are confident that we could've eventually completed all ideas we thought of.

- [x] User can set up goals they want to reach
- [x] User can input their food choices
- [x] User can input their lifestyle habits
- [x] User can correctly sign in and sign up
- [x] App automatically tracks input to encourage behavioral changes
- [x] User can look at app suggestions for improving diet / habits
- [x] User can view their improvements over time
- [x] User can switch between tabs using a tab control bar
- [x] Completed app icon and launch screen
- [x] User can link with friends to track each other as well
